* Are the forces of a mechanics problem part of the `experiment` (e.g. boundary forces) or part of the `problem` (aka the form, e.g. volume/body forces)?
    * Would it be _inconsistent_ to mix that? Boundary --> `experiment`, volume --> `problem`

* How to differ between static and quasistatic and dynamic _measurements_?
    * Different sensors?
    * Different experiment (add_sensor_data) API
