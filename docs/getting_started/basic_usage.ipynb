Note, that there is no prescribed way of passing parameters to the model. Some models may be implemented for all variants of `StressStrainConstraint` and therefore have the constraint as a parameter, but some models may only be implemented for 3D problems."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from fenics_constitutive.models import LinearElasticityModel\n","from fenics_constitutive import StressStrainConstraint\n","\n","parameters = {\"E\": 42., \"nu\": 0.3}\n","\n","model = LinearElasticityModel(parameters, StressStrainConstraint.PLANE_STRAIN)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Defining the problem\n","\n","Next, define the mesh and the boundary conditions.
